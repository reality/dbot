# Depressionbot IRC Bot

## Introduction

Depressionbot is an IRC bot which aims to be the fanciest IRC bot around - On
the general standard of software fanciness, dbot is statistically rated as being 
'82% the same as bathing in fine, fine grape juice.'

Please note that this documentation is not complete and is a work in progress, 
given I started it rather a long time after I began development of the project. 
Please don't judge me too harshly for this as I am, in fact, mildly allergic to
writing documentation.

## Getting Started

You can install DBot's dependencies, configure and run the bot for the first
time with the following command:

```
sh install.sh
```
